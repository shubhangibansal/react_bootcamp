# react_bootcamp
# whenever you input data, basically you are changing the state and so state should be within component.
# There is a diff in defining and invoking a funv=c. When using a lambda func , we are actually defining the data.
# Not necessarily we need to bind method in constructor only, we can also do the same in the rendering part also.
# whenever there is a change in state, render() is called everytime.However constructor is called only once. So, it's always better to bind in constructor.
# its better to use concat insteadof push to add new elemnt in an array, because we dont want to modify the array  or state directly. Rather create new one.
